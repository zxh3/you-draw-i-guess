# You Draw I Guess

This is a easy but fun to play game.

- During each round of the game, one player in the room will be designated as the "drawer", and the rest of the players will act as "guessers".
- The drawer will be assigned one word from the word list, and the drawer should try one's best to depict the words using his/her paintbrush.
- The guessers should try their best to guess what is the word designated to the drawers, and type the word in the chat message box once they have a clue.
- The more guessers guess correctly, the more scores will the drawer win.
- The earlier the guessers guess the word correctly, the more scores will the guessers win.
